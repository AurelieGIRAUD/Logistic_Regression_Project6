## Project 6 - Logistic Regression: Create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm.

This repository get through the key learnings related to the Project no.6.
  
ðŸŽ¯ Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, your role is to create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression. This project includes the following steps:

  1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
  - Data Visualizations
  
  2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  - Scree Plot Analysis
  - Loadings Plots
  - Scores Plots
  - Selection of the principal components
  
  3) Clustering with Kmean
  
  - Exploring the structure of the data with data visualizations
  - Performances Analysis
  
  4) Logistic Regression
  
  - Train and apply a logistic regression model to predict whether a banknotes is fake or genuine based on its characteristics
  - Performances Analysis
  - Wrap the model into a function
