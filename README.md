## Project 6 - Logistic Regression: Create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm.

This repository get through the key learnings related to the Project no.6.
  
ðŸŽ¯ Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression. This project includes the following steps:

  1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
  - Data Visualizations supported by MatplotLib.
  
  2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  - Scree Plot Analysis.
  - Loadings Plots.
  - Scores Plots.
  - Selection of the principal components.
  
  3) Clustering with Kmean
  
  - Exploring patterns and structure with data visualizations.
  - Performances Analysis.
  
  4) Logistic Regression
  
  - Train and Apply a logistic regression model to detect fake banknotes using their dimensions.
  - Performances Analysis.
