This repository get through the key learnings related to the Project no.6: "Create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression".

## Project 6 - Logistic Regression: Create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm.
Using a labelled dataset containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes, your role is to create a counterfeit banknote detection algorithm based on Logistic Regression. This project includes the following steps:

  1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
  - Data Visualizations
  
  2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  
  3) Logistic Regression.
